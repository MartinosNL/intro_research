# Relation between tweets and political results
## General information
This research aims to research if the frequency at witch political parties are mentioned is connected to the amount of seats in the Dutch parliament.


## Background information
Twitter is a platform used by a lot of politicians. Look at the presidential elections in the United States of 2017, where Donald Trump used tweets to gain traction for his political views. [[1]](#1) One third of tweets from U.S. adults are political, those ages 50 and older produce 78% of all political tweets from U.S. adults. [[2]](#2). So twitter is a platform that is used a lot in politics, so would it be possible to use twitter to predict elections?


## Research question
Can the frequency at which political parties are mentioned in Dutch tweets be seen in election results?

## Hypothesis 
There will not be a significant relation between the frequency of mentions on twitter and the results of the elections of 2012 and 2017, because political parties also get mentioned when they stand for something people don't believe in.

## Method
This research does this by extracting tweets from the RUG corpus of tweets, collected from 2010-now. To research this question we take the amount of tweets a certain political party is mentioned every day for the last ten days before the 2012 and 2017 election. This amount will be devided by the total amount of tweets in those days. This will give a percentage of tweets that a specific party is mentioned. Then it will be possible to compare their relative percantages to eachother and compare that to the amount of seats every political party got in the election.
