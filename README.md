# Relation between tweets and political results
## Abstract
The aim of this study is to check weather or not the amount of mentions on twitter the week before the elections can predict the election results. We use a Python script to run throug the RUG Karora server to take tweets from the week before the election. We then use the Python script to count the amount of times every political party that finished top-eight is mentioned. We then compare this to the actual election results and find that there is a big difference between the amount of mentions and the actual election results.


## Background information
Twitter is a platform used by a lot of politicians. Take a look at the presidential elections in the United States of 2017, where Donald Trump used tweets to gain traction for his political views Kreis (2017). According to Mitchell (2022), one third of tweets from U.S. adults are political, those ages 50 and older produce 78% of all political tweets from U.S. adults. So Twitter is a platform that is used a lot for expressing political opinions. Sanders and van den Bosch (2020) already did quite a lot of research on this topic. They studied the relation between the number of mentions of political parties in the last few weeks prior to the elections and the results of the election. They didn’t only take a look at how often a party was mentioned, they also looked into the context of the mentioning, so for example if the tweet was positive or negative, if it was sarcastic etc. When using computer annotation, the prediction was not that close, and with manual annotation the prediction was closer but still not perfect. The annotation for this would take too much time to research for this class, so we chose to only look into the amount of mentions for this study.



## Research question
Knowing that, we can think of a research question: ’Would it be possible to use the amount of times a political party gets mentioned on Twitter to predict elections?’ 

## Hypothesis 
The hypotheses is that there will not be a significant relation between the frequency of mentions on Twitter and the results of the elections of 2012 and 2017, because political parties also get mentioned when they stand for something people don’t believe in. There is the independent variable amount of mentions a party has on Twitter the week before the election and the dependent variable is the amount of seats the party got in the election.


## Method
This paper aims to answer that question by using a Python script to check how often political parties get mentioned in the week beforethe 2017 and 2021 election. Then these results get compared to the results of the election to see if the percentage of mentions on Twitter is equal to the percentage of votes a party receives
